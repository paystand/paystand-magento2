- [ ] Verify backward compatibility
- [ ] Check all supported PHP versions
- [ ] Validate in different Magento versions

### 4. Pre-Release Tasks
- [ ] Final code review
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Document any known issues

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Directory structure changes
- Type declaration additions
- Interface implementations

### Medium Risk
- Backward compatibility
- Multi-version PHP support

### High Risk
- Payment processing impact
- Webhook functionality

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Set up test environment
2. Run validation scripts
3. Test payment flow
4. Verify webhooks

### Before Production Push
1. Complete all test cases
2. Verify in staging environment
3. Document test results
4. Prepare rollback plan

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Testing (1-2 days)
- Environment setup
- Initial testing
- Bug fixes if needed

### Phase 2: Validation (1 day)
- Payment processing
- Webhook verification
- Log analysis

### Phase 3: Deployment (1 day)
- Final testing
- Documentation update
- Production deployment
- Monitoring

## Support Plan

### During Testing
- Monitor error logs
- Document any issues
- Prepare fixes if needed

### Post-Deployment
- Monitor payment processing
- Watch for webhook failures
- Ready for quick rollback if needed

## Questions to Address

1. Test Environment
   - Do we have access to all required versions?
   - Are sandbox credentials available?
   - Is staging environment ready?

2. Testing Scope
   - Which Magento versions to test?
   - Which payment scenarios to verify?
   - What webhook tests are needed?

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Gradual rollout or full deployment?
   - Monitoring plan?
   - Support team readiness?

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review test environment requirements
2. Confirm testing scope
3. Finalize deployment strategy
4. Set timeline for production push
